The variables created in the code are

labels: Activity labels
features: Feature names (measurements)
Xtst: Test data for X (measurements)
ytst: Test Data for Y ( activitity numbers, activity names added later as second column)
Xtrain: Training Data for X (measurements)
ytrain: Training data for Y ( activitity numbers, activity names added later as second column)
subtest: Subjects chosen for test set
subtrain: Subjects chosen for training set
DataX: Xtrain and Xtst data combined
DataY: ytrain and ytst data combined
subjects: Test and train subjects combined
mnstd: Logical variable which has mean and std string in the feature names
        Indexing this variable on the features will allow us to select features whose names which have mean and std in them.
TDataXmeas: Xtrain and Xtst data with selected features
Trainmeas: Xtrain data with selected features
Testmeas: Xtest data with selected features
DataYact: combined ytrain and ytst data
A: The variable which contains the aggregate results of mean of selected measurement per subject for each activity.
